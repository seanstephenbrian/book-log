Last year we decided to design a typeface that would merge quirkiness with legibility to help people with visual impairments. It got sidelined for a few reasons so we’ve decided to give away the complete regular weight for free, for you to use however you want.

We’re hoping to return to this project in the future, so feedback on legibility would be really helpful, and one day it might end up a fully fleshed out family…
